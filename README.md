## How is the code organized in this repo ?
The whole repo is divided into multiple branches. Each branch contains code for a specific concept. For example _session1_ has the code base for user registration and login . Each branch is built on the top of the previous branch

## Prerequisite
- Understanding of Node.js
- Understanding of Async Await
- Mongo DB locally installed and running

## Tech
- Node.js
- Mongodb


## Installation

this app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
